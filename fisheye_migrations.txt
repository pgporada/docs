Fisheye migrations from Atlassian Ondemand
# Need to have their repos cut out of the backup.zip's config.xml and put into our own config.xml, best to use a split screen or two terminals

# Example from OfficeDepot
Ondemand: /data/jirastudio/svn/root

Our SVN location: /opt/svn/repositories/officedepot.com/repositories

In Vim, run the following regex to replace the OnDemand paths (lol toothpick forest)

%s/\/data\/jirastudio\/svn\/root/\/opt\/svn\/repositories\/officedepot.com\/repositories/g
